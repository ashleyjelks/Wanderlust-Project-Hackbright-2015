### What is Wanderlust?
Wanderlust is a Python-Flask based group travel app that aims to simplify planning group travel. Flight data is queried from Google Flights'â€‹ API, stored in a SQLite database and passed to users to deliver competitive airline ticket prices for two travelers, departing from two different locations, who wish to meet in the same city. It also takes into consideration each traveler's budget, by searching for flights that meet each traveler's specified budget. Users who have created an account and are logged in while searching have the option to save the results of their queries to their account.

### About the Developer
Wanderlust was designed and developed by Ashley Jelks, a San Francisco Bay Area based full-stack software engineer. She is an avid traveler, having been to over 25 countries and counting. Looking for opportunities to simplify her travels with friends who live in other parts of the United States, she developed Wanderlust during her time at Hackbright Acadmemy, San Francisco's only engineering school for women. She made the transition to technology from her previous career as a public high school teacher in New York City. Ashley is interested in the intersections of technology, business, education, and culture, and is always looking for new tech frameworks to explore. She's also a ridiculously huge fan of Swedish Fish, cats and other furry mammals, and ramen.
